## Michaela's Baptism Website

[Kostas Deployed Website](https://ksarvanitakis.github.io/1st-milestone-project/)

Hi! This is a website for my doughter's baptism, which is going to take place next summer. The whole idea is to use a simple website like this,  
which is able to conceptualize the first info of the eventin the form of a "save the Date" electronic card. 
The main scope is to inform the guests of the event itself, give some personal touch with a couple of pictures as well as some contact details in case someone has a question.

This website is made only for educational purposes and nothing more than that. 



## UX

1. The first page introduces the user to the main website and gives simultanuesly a clear idea of the event that is going to take place.
A cute picture of the baby itself, makes the environment friendlier and gives a clear impression of who is this invitation about.


2. On the the second page, user has already clicked on the Event and gets a good idea of when and where the baptism is gonna take place.


3. Going further on the Godparents page, user gets to know the people that will have the responsibility to be in charge of the whole ritual. 
The user feels more engaged and has even the chance to see two beautiful pictures of the maybe unknown to them pesons.

4. Giving a last touch to this "save the date"-type website, is some more pictures of Michaela, as well as one of the whole family. 

5. Last but not least, the telephone numbers of both the parents exist in all the webpages.
